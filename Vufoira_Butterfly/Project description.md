This is an AR project developed to understand the basics and fundamentals of the Vuforia Engine. Through this project, I gained knowledge about the Vuforia Engine, AR Core, and the Unity tool. I learned how to display a 3D animated model when scanning an image pattern using my dedicated app camera.

The project works like this: when I scan a particular butterfly image with my app camera, a 3D animated model is augmented above the scanned image.
